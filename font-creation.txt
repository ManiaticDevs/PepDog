To make a new font texture:
- run runnable-hiero.jar (http://web.archive.org/web/20151012082035/https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/runnables/runnable-hiero.jar)
- select the font you want
- set from "sample text" to "glyph cache"
- set font size until the page count reaches 2 (must remain 1) (63 is a relatively compatible size)
- set padding (bottom right) to 8 each, leave x and y as 0 (please)
- on the effects list, add "Distance field" and remove "color"
- set values on the distance field effect: spread to 10 and scale to 15

BE AWARE PROGRAM SHOULD STOP RESPONDING (THATS OKAY)

once it comes back:
- go to file > save as bmfont file (.fnt)
- save to UND-J/resources/assets/fonts/
 
go to UNDECIDED.java and change the value of String fontType in the main method to the name you saved it as.
