# Engine
### Roblox Clone in LWJGL2

This is a OpenGL project which loads the old .rbxl format (or .rbxlx) into something displayable.

The engine itself includes aabb collision.

TODO : 
- set player to spawn location
- change player model to appropiate one
- add different types of models for the parts
- aabb collision
- proper physics
- lua loading :/
